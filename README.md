## What is AIGIT?

AIGIT is a next-generation version control system that seamlessly integrates artificial intelligence into your development workflow. Built from the ground up in Rust, it combines the reliability of traditional VCS with the power of modern AI to provide intelligent code analysis, automated commit messages, smart branch suggestions, and proactive code reviews.

## Features

### AI-Powered Intelligence
- **Smart Commit Messages**: Automatically generate meaningful commit messages based on code changes
- **Intelligent Branch Naming**: AI suggests optimal branch names based on your code changes
- **Automated Code Review**: Get instant feedback on code quality, security, and best practices
- **Conflict Resolution**: AI-assisted merge conflict resolution with intelligent suggestions
- **Codebase Analysis**: Deep understanding of your project structure and patterns

### Enterprise-Grade Security
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data encrypted using AES-GCM with Argon2 key derivation
- **Digital Signatures**: Ring-based cryptographic signatures for commit integrity
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security audit trails with SHA-256 hashing
- **Permission Management**: Granular access controls and user authentication
- **Secure by Design**: Built with Rust's memory safety guarantees

### High Performance
- **Async Architecture**: Built on Tokio for maximum concurrency and performance
- **Efficient Storage**: Advanced compression algorithms using FLATE2
- **Fast Operations**: Optimized for large codebases and complex histories
- **Memory Safe**: Zero-cost abstractions with Rust's ownership system
- **Scalable**: Designed for teams of any size

### Beautiful User Experience
- **Colorful CLI**: Rich terminal output with progress indicators
- **Interactive Prompts**: Intuitive command-line interface with helpful suggestions
- **Comprehensive Help**: Extensive documentation and command help
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (2021 edition)
- Git (for comparison and migration)
- Internet connection (for AI features)

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bas3line/aigit.git
cd aigit
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize a new AIGIT repository
aigit init

# Configure your identity
aigit config user --name "Your Name" --email "your.email@example.com"

# Enable AI features
aigit config set ai.enabled true

# Add files and make your first AI-powered commit
aigit add .
aigit commit --ai-review

# Create an AI-suggested branch
aigit branch --ai-suggest

# Get AI code review
aigit review --full
```

## Commands Overview

### Repository Management
```bash
aigit init [--bare]              # Initialize repository
aigit config <action>            # Configure settings
aigit status [-p, --porcelain]   # Show repository status
```

### Change Management
```bash
aigit add <files> [--all]        # Stage changes
aigit commit [options]           # Create commits with AI
aigit diff [--cached] [--ai-explain]  # View changes with AI insights
```

### Branch Operations
```bash
aigit branch [name] [options]    # Manage branches with AI suggestions
aigit checkout <target> [-c]     # Switch branches or commits
aigit merge <branch> [--ai-resolve]  # Merge with AI conflict resolution
```

### AI Features
```bash
aigit review [--full]            # AI-powered code review
aigit suggest <type>             # Get AI recommendations
aigit log [--ai-summary]         # View history with AI summaries
```

## Configuration

AIGIT supports both global and repository-specific configurations:

### AI Configuration
```bash
aigit config set ai.enabled true
aigit config set ai.model "gemini-pro"
aigit config set ai.temperature 0.7
```

### Security Configuration
```bash
aigit config set security.requireSignature true
aigit config set security.auditLog true
aigit config set commit.gpgsign true
```

### Core Settings
```bash
aigit config set core.editor "vim"
aigit config set core.autocrlf true
```
